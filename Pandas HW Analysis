This video game is vastly more popular with Men, but Men did not neccisarily spend more per person than Women (Women spent $0.40 more on average) although Men still made the vast majority of Revinue.

The vast majority of players were in the 15-35 year old range (675 players), forming a bell that peaks in the 20-24 range (365 players). 

Again, the most popular ranges made up the most profits but only fell into the median in the "total purchase per person" category. The 35-40 group and <10 group spent significantly more per person.
